## Project Overview   


MyCRUTECH is an app i built as my Bachelor of Science Project work. The topic of the project was DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A STUDENT GUIDE FOR REGISTRING AND CLEARING STUDENTS in CRUTECH. The project was aimed at designing a system that guides newly admitted students on how to go about thier registration in the university. The app gave them information about what document was needed for a successful registration and also using google map API, it gave them directions to the office where different registration is done, also helping them keep track of thier progress. The app was not limited to Registering student, it also guided students undergoeing Clearance on how to go about thier clearance, indicating all the documents needed for clearnce, and offices for the clerance.
